# Discourse Zero-Click SSO Plugin

This plugin ✨ automagically ✨ logs in users to Discourse forums.

## How do I use this plugin?

1. Enable the plugin (easy start)
2. Disable local-login on your Discourse forum (cool, cool)
3. Configure a single SSO source (gotta pick)

### Example

Let's say you go with GitHub. Your users are developers. They're definitely logged into GitHub. When they visit your Discourse forum for the first time, we'll log them in automatically. Like magic.

### What if they're not signed into GitHub?

No worries! They'll just browse anonymously. Happy as clams.

### What if they're already logged into the Discourse forum?

Even less worries! We won't do a thing.
